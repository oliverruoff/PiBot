A robot using a Raspberry Pi as main unit.

## What is it
The goal of PiBot is to be a small robot that can autonomously drive around in the house and maybe in the future to do some more or less useful stuff :D 
The "eyes" of the robot is an ultra sonic sensor, using the usdar software developed under [Github Usdar](https://github.com/vanslipon/usdar).

## 3D Model for the robot
The 3d model of the robot is developed with [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/).
The .stl file(s) will be stored in the [stl](stl) folder of this repository.
Simply print them out using any 3d printer and start building your PiBot :)

## Instructions on how to build the robot
- Use circuit diagram to wire everything up 
- Hot glue is your best friend :D
- Good luck
